export const DEPT_ASST_DESC = "Departmental assistant within the College of Information and Computer Sciences. Assisted with the development of " + 
    "fairkit-learn, a python-based tool used to compute and visualize fairness and quality metrics of machine learning models. Used the Bokeh library " + 
    "for python to create an interactive visualization tool that provides information about bias in trained models. Created a pipeline to integrate " +
    "metrics and fairness algorithms from IBM's AI Fairness 360 Toolkit into fairkit-learn."

export const SCALA_WEB_DESC = "Full stack developer for the UMass College of Information and Computer Science's MS and " +
    "PhD Admissions website. The system is used annually by over 80 faculty members of the CICS department to review over 2000 applicants per year. " +
    "Responsible for improving relational database design patterns by rewriting old PostgreSQL schemas, addressing plugin compatibility" +
    " issues on the front end by migrating from Scala.js to Typescript + React, implementing a custom sorting algorithm to rank " +
    "schools according to CS quality, and creating a cache to preserve user preferences between login sessions.";

export const GOOGLE_INTERN_DESC = "Software Engineer Intern on the Site Reliability Team. Responsible for creating a website " +
    "encompassing the functionality of a command-line tool used by Google engineers to automate dependency resolution for their code release pipeline." +
    " Authored a project design document detailing the problem statement, system requirements, UI mock-ups, user stories, test cases, " +
    "design trade-offs and future development of the new web application. On the back end, I implemented an indexing pipeline in Go " +
    "that broadcasts database updates to the webserver to keep the most recent results ready in cache.";

export const CRA_INTERN_DESC = "Software Engineer Intern within the Decision Management division. Aided in full-stack development of a React.js " +
    "application designed to detect system hardware failures on-board ships in the Navy. Improved fault detecting by ~15% by formulating Bayesian Network " +
    " models using the Figaro probabilistic programming package for Scala. I used the new classification results to create a d3.js " +
    "visualization to inform ship operators where faults are likely to happen.";

export const UGTA_DESC = "Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for CS 220 (Functional Programming Using Scala). Worked as one of six " +
    "undergraduates chosen to orchestrate class discussions sections and hold weekly office hours for a class of over 150 students. " +
    "Introduced students to functional programming concepts such as immutability, higher-order functions, algebraic data types, recursive data structures " +
    "and referential transparency.";

export const TXTADVICE_DESC = "Led the development of an online SMS/MMS messaging service providing users with real-time fashion " +
    "advice from professional stylists (featured on CNN!). I built a RESTful API using Flask + PostgreSQL, and implemented the messaging " +
    "interface using React.js. A bit further down the line, I was able to write Postgres queries to analyse usage statistics to better " +
    "inform stylists of the clothing preferences for a given user.";
